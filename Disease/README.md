#   Disease Prediction using machine learning

## Brief

This project aims to be able to provide the possibility of a person contracting a disease given a set of factors. Aimed at kids but can be extended to work with adults.

## Detailed description of the project

The cliche of "prevention is better than cure" has always been one of the most relevant topics in the field of health sciences. At present doctors rely on data provided by the patient when they are suffering from a particular disease. Obviously this might lead to certain factors being noticed when it is too late to take a preventive measure.Thousands of such cases can be found in any place in the world. This project aims to reduce the probability of that happening. Using machine learning, a relatively accurate prediction of the diseases a person in a set of circumstances has a probability of contracting in the future. This data can be then be used by the doctor/ medical personnel to map out tests as well as personalized preventive action to be taken. Using direct data as well as certain criteria it is possible to create a personalized model and thus can help in saving a life as well as "preventing" a preventable disease.
