# The-world

- Code to both keep a journal and learn from experts. 

- All the code in this repo is my own and not copied from any where

- Any codes which look alike is unintentional

- There are codes of python, HTML, api.ai, C++ etc..

- Please fork instead of downloading. Ive put it up in hopes that it would help someone somwhere, but they did take a lot of time and effort and I would appreciate it if you respected that.
